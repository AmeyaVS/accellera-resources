3) Other changes

  - None.


4) Known limitations
====================

Here is a list of known limitations in this release:

  - Not all options of the verify.pl script are fully functional.

  - The regression test suite currently covers about 80% of the
    SystemC source code. We strive to get this number up to 100%.
    Especially for the data types more tests are needed.

  - The organization of the tests in the test suite can (and must) be
    improved.

  - Some datatype tests take a long time to either compile or run.
